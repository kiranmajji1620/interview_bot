Projects
ChefGPT W | Python, Langchain, Groq, Streamlit Jun 2024
• Developed an AI-powered personal chef assistant using LangChain and Streamlit, capable of suggesting recipes
based on ingredients or dietary preferences, with allergy-friendly filtering while maintaining the context throughout
the conversation.
• Integrated external APIs to fetch relevant data, implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agents in
Langchain and created an interactive UI with Streamlit to provide a seamless and engaging experience.
Tutor RAG W | Python, LangChain, Streamlit, ChromaDB Jun 2024
• Developed an AI tutoring application using LangChain, Streamlit, and ChromaDB for context-aware conversation.
• Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the accuracy and relevance of responses.
• Designed an interactive UI with Streamlit to provide a user-friendly experience.
Road Safety and Accident Analysis | Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn Mar 2024
• Data Analytics challenge aimed at improving road safety through AI-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems
(ADAS).
• Identified patterns and trends related to road safety by analyzing factors like speed, location, and alert types to
pinpoint high-risk areas (black spots) where accidents frequently occur.
